This repository contains solutions for CSE102 Assignment 11. The assignment consists of three tasks focusing on recursion, optimization, and card shuffling. Below is an overview of each part, along with instructions on how to compile and run the code.

Part 2: Sustainable Health Services (sustainable_health_services.c)

Part 3: Virtual Card Game Mixer (card_game_mixer.c)

      Part 1: Smart City Navigation

Problem:
In this task, we help an Amazon Scout robot find the optimal paths to return to the dispatch center from a given intersection in a city grid. The robot can only move west (left) or south (down). The goal is to compute the number of possible paths using recursion.

Key Concepts:

Recursive pathfinding in a grid

The robot can only move in two directions (left or down).

      Part 2: Sustainable Health Services

Problem:
This task involves determining whether it's possible to provide healthcare services to all cities in a country, given a limited number of hospitals and a list of which cities each hospital can serve. The solution uses recursion to check different combinations of hospitals and ensure all cities are covered.

Key Concepts:

Recursion to evaluate all possible hospital combinations.

Coverage optimization for cities based on hospitals' service areas.

      Part 3: Virtual Card Game Mixer

Problem:
In this task, we create a virtual deck of cards, shuffle the cards, and display them in randomized order. Each card is represented by a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and a face (Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King). The goal is to ensure no duplicate cards exist and the deck is shuffled correctly.

Key Concepts:

Card struct with face and suit.

Randomized shuffling of a deck of 52 cards.
