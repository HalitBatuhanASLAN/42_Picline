                                                  AI Model for Data Classification
This project implements a basic artificial intelligence algorithm using the C programming language. The goal is to explore a dataset, train a model to classify data points, and evaluate the model's performance.


                                                    Features

Data Exploration: Reads a dataset from a file, calculates and displays the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates for each class.

AI Model Construction: Implements a simple classification model based on the coordinates provided, determining the best separators to minimize classification errors.

Testing and Evaluation: Tests the model against a separate dataset and calculates the success rate based on accurate predictions.


User Menu: Provides an interactive menu for exploring data, training the model, testing the model, and exiting the program.

                                                    Data Structure
The program does not use arrays or user-defined functions, as per the assignment requirements. It operates with basic variables to handle input and data processing.

                                                    Functions

Data Exploration: Reads data from data.txt, calculates the min and max values for X and Y coordinates, and prints them.

Model Training: Implements a classification model that finds the optimal separators for classification based on the dataset.

Model Testing: Reads from test.txt to predict class labels based on the trained model and computes the success rate.

Menu System: Provides a continuous menu interface for user interaction until the exit option is selected.
