                                                CSE102 Assignment 1 - Encrypting and Decrypting C Code
This project consists of two main parts: encrypting valid C code and decrypting the encrypted text. The encryption is performed using a special Caesar cipher method based on a provided student ID. Comments in the C code are treated differently, with a marker indicating their presence instead of encrypting them.

                                                  Features
Part 1: Encrypting C Code

Ignore Comments: The program reads a C code input while ignoring comments enclosed in /* */. Instead, it replaces them with a marker indicating the number of characters in the comment.
Caesar Cipher Encryption: The rest of the characters in the C code are encrypted using a Caesar cipher based on a key derived from the user's student ID.

Part 2: Decrypting C Code
Decrypt Comments: When decrypting, the program recognizes the markers for comments and displays a message indicating the number of characters in the comment.
Reverse Caesar Cipher: The rest of the encrypted characters are decrypted using the reverse of the encryption method, applying the same key derived from the student ID.

Key Calculation
The key for the Caesar cipher is calculated by summing the digits of the student ID until a single-digit result is obtained.

Example Student ID Calculation
For a student ID of 220104004003:

Sum of digits: 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 20
Further reduce: 2 + 0 = 2
Key: 2

                              Input Format
C Code Input: The user is prompted to enter valid C code, which may include comments.
Encrypted Text Input: For decryption, the user provides the encrypted text generated by the encryption program.
                                
                                Usage
        Encryption:

The user inputs valid C code.
The program outputs the encrypted C code, showing the transformed characters and comments.
        Decryption:

The user inputs the encrypted C code.
The program outputs the decrypted C code, including comments with their lengths.

                              Implementation Details
alphabet[61]: An array containing all the characters considered for encryption and decryption.

                              Functions:

finding_key(): Calculates the key based on the student ID.

finding_in_alphabet(): Finds the index of a character in the alphabet array.
Functions to encrypt and decrypt characters, handle comments, and manage input/output.
